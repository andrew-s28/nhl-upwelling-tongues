# NHL Upwelling Tongues

This repository contains exploratory analyses including investigating the presence of "tongues" of recently upwelled waters off the Oregon coast as well as some other related explorations into NHL upwelling dynamics.

The main analysis notebook, for now, is [along_isopycnal_anomaly.ipynb](/notebooks/along_isopycnal_anomaly.ipynb). It contains data download and figure production code.

Run this notebook by:

1. `git clone https://github.com/andrew-s28/nhl-upwelling-tongues.git`
2. `uv sync`
3. Select `.venv` when running the notebook
